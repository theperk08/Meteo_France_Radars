Decoding Bufr file from the french Meteo France data weather service : 

- free register at the official API : https://portail-api.meteofrance.fr/web/  
 
- you must download the bufr tables from here :  
https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/client/document/tables_bufr_361.zip  

- then you can use my jupyter notebook (MeteoFrance_Bufr_Decoder.ipynb) to decode your bufr file (from the API : Donn√©es radar),  
you only need to change the first cell under the PROGRAM cell  
(directory and file name,  directory tables and if you want to print all the infos or only a summary)
